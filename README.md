# Global-Terrorism

An in-depth visual and intellectual analysis of terrorist attacks over time that have been commited around the world. This was the final project in CMSC320: Introduction to Data Science, at the University of Maryland, College Park.

This was a group project developed from scratch by Glen Joy, Dane Dixon, and Arushi Tayal. Data pulled from START at https://www.start.umd.edu/.

The analysis pulls records of terrorism-related incidents occurring in 1970 and onward, and takes an in-depth look at those attacks occuring in 2000 and onward, taking into account factors such as geographical location, type of attack, weapons used, casualty count, and success rate. Visualizing these factors helps us analyze patterns in terrorism over time such as countries or regions where they are more likely to occur, terrorist groups that are the most active, and how the frequency/severity those attacks are increasing or decreasing over time.
