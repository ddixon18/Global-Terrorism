# Global-Terrorism

An in-depth visual and intellectual analysis of terrorist attacks over time that have been commited around the world. This was the final project in CMSC320: Introduction to Data Science, at the University of Maryland, College Park. Analysis done in Jupyter Notebooks, using Python labraries including Pandas, MatPlotLib, and SKLearn.

This was a group project developed from scratch by Glen Joy, Dane Dixon, and Arushi Tayal. Data pulled from START at https://www.start.umd.edu/.

The analysis pulls records of terrorism-related incidents occurring from 1970 onward, and takes an in-depth look at those attacks occuring from 2000 onward taking into account factors such as geographical location, type of attack, weapons used, casualty count, and effectiveness. Visualizing these factors helps us analyze patterns in terrorism over time including regions in which the attacks are more prominent, terrorist groups that are the most active, and how the frequency/severity of those attacks change of time.
